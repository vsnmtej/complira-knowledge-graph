# Workflow State

Use this file as the mandatory stage-control artifact for the ticket.
Update this file before every stage transition and before any source-code edit.
Stage movement is controlled by this file's Stage Transition Contract + Transition Matrix.

## Current Snapshot

- Ticket:
- Current Stage: `0` / `1` / `2` / `3` / `4` / `5` / `6` / `7` / `8` / `9` / `10`
- Next Stage:
- Code Edit Permission: `Locked` / `Unlocked`
- Active Re-Entry: `No` / `Yes`
- Re-Entry Classification (`Local Fix`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`/`Unclear`): `N/A`
- Last Transition ID:

## Stage Gates

| Stage | Gate Status (`Not Started`/`In Progress`/`Pass`/`Fail`/`Blocked`) | Gate Rule Summary | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 Bootstrap + Draft Requirement | Not Started | Ticket bootstrap complete + `requirements.md` Draft captured |  |
| 1 Investigation + Triage | Not Started | `investigation-notes.md` current + scope triage recorded |  |
| 2 Requirements | Not Started | `requirements.md` is `Design-ready`/`Refined` |  |
| 3 Design Basis | Not Started | Design basis updated for scope (`implementation-plan.md` sketch or `proposed-design.md`) |  |
| 4 Runtime Modeling | Not Started | `future-state-runtime-call-stack.md` current |  |
| 5 Review Gate | Not Started | Runtime review `Go Confirmed` (two clean rounds, no blockers/persisted updates/new use cases) |  |
| 6 Implementation | Not Started | Plan/progress current + source + unit/integration verification complete |  |
| 7 API/E2E Testing | Not Started | API/E2E test implementation complete + AC scenario gate complete |  |
| 8 Code Review | Not Started | Code review gate `Pass`/`Fail` recorded |  |
| 9 Docs Sync | Not Started | Docs updated or no-impact rationale recorded |  |
| 10 Handoff / Ticket State | Not Started | Final handoff complete + ticket state decision recorded |  |

## Stage Transition Contract (Quick Reference)

| Stage | Exit Condition | On Fail/Blocked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Bootstrap complete + `requirements.md` is `Draft` | stay in `0` |
| 1 | `investigation-notes.md` current + scope triage recorded | stay in `1` |
| 2 | `requirements.md` is `Design-ready`/`Refined` | stay in `2` |
| 3 | Design basis current for scope | stay in `3` |
| 4 | Runtime call stack current | stay in `4` |
| 5 | Runtime review `Go Confirmed` (two clean rounds with no blockers/no required persisted artifact updates/no newly discovered use cases) | classified re-entry then rerun (`Design Impact`: `3 -> 4 -> 5`, `Requirement Gap`: `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, `Unclear`: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`) |
| 6 | Source + required unit/integration verification complete | stay in `6` |
| 7 | API/E2E gate closes all executable mapped acceptance criteria (`Passed` or explicit user `Waived`) | `Blocked` on infeasible/no waiver; otherwise classified re-entry |
| 8 | Code review gate decision is `Pass` | classified re-entry then rerun |
| 9 | Docs updated or no-impact rationale recorded | stay in `9` |
| 10 | Final handoff complete; ticket move requires explicit user confirmation | stay in `10`/`in-progress` |

## Transition Matrix (Reference)

| Trigger | Required Transition Path | Gate Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal forward progression | `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10` | Pass |
| Stage 5 blocker (`Design Impact`) | `3 -> 4 -> 5` | Fail |
| Stage 5 blocker (`Requirement Gap`) | `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` | Fail |
| Stage 5 blocker (`Unclear`) | `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` | Fail |
| Stage 6 unit/integration failure | stay in `6` | Fail |
| Stage 7 failure (`Local Fix`) | `6 -> 7` | Fail |
| Stage 7 failure (`Design Impact`) | `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7` | Fail |
| Stage 7 failure (`Requirement Gap`) | `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7` | Fail |
| Stage 7 failure (`Unclear`/cross-cutting root cause) | `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7` | Fail |
| Stage 7 infeasible criteria without explicit user waiver | stay in `7` | Blocked |
| Stage 8 failure (`Local Fix`) | `6 -> 7 -> 8` | Fail |
| Stage 8 failure (`Design Impact`) | `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8` | Fail |
| Stage 8 failure (`Requirement Gap`) | `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8` | Fail |
| Stage 8 failure (`Unclear`/cross-cutting root cause) | `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8` | Fail |

Note:
- In re-entry paths, Stage 0 means re-open bootstrap controls in the same ticket/worktree (`workflow-state.md`, lock state, artifact baselines); do not create a new ticket folder.
- For Stage 5 failures, record classified re-entry first; then persist artifact updates in the returned upstream stage before running the next Stage 5 round.

## Pre-Edit Checklist (Stage 6 Source-Code Edits)

- Current Stage is `6`: `Yes` / `No`
- Code Edit Permission is `Unlocked`: `Yes` / `No`
- Stage 5 gate is `Go Confirmed`: `Yes` / `No`
- Required upstream artifacts are current: `Yes` / `No`
- Pre-Edit Checklist Result: `Pass` / `Fail`
- If `Fail`, source code edits are prohibited.

## Re-Entry Declaration

- Trigger Stage (`5`/`7`/`8`):
- Classification (`Local Fix`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`/`Unclear`):
- Required Return Path:
- Required Upstream Artifacts To Update Before Code Edits:
- Resume Condition:

Note:
- Stage 5 re-entry normally uses `Design Impact` / `Requirement Gap` / `Unclear` only (not `Local Fix`).
