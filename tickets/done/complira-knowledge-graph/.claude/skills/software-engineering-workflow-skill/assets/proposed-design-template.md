## Summary

## Goals

## Legacy Removal Policy (Mandatory)

- Policy: `No backward compatibility; remove legacy code paths.`
- Required action: identify and remove obsolete legacy paths/files included in this scope.

## Requirements And Use Cases

| Requirement ID | Description | Acceptance Criteria ID(s) | Acceptance Criteria Summary | Use Case IDs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-001 |  | AC-001 |  | UC-001 |

## Codebase Understanding Snapshot (Pre-Design Mandatory)

| Area | Findings | Evidence (files/functions) | Open Unknowns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entrypoints / Boundaries |  |  |  |
| Current Naming Conventions |  |  |  |
| Impacted Modules / Responsibilities |  |  |  |
| Data / Persistence / External IO |  |  |  |

## Current State (As-Is)

## Target State (To-Be)

## Architecture Direction Decision (Mandatory)

- Chosen direction:
- Rationale (`complexity`, `testability`, `operability`, `evolution cost`):
- Layering fitness assessment (are current layering and interactions still coherent?): `Yes` / `No`
- Outcome (`Keep`/`Add`/`Split`/`Merge`/`Move`/`Remove`):
- Note: `Keep` is valid when layering and boundary interactions are already coherent.

### Optional Alternatives (Use For Non-Trivial Or Uncertain Changes)

| Option | Summary | Pros | Cons | Decision (`Chosen`/`Rejected`) | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A |  |  |  |  |  |
| B |  |  |  |  |  |

## Change Inventory (Delta)

| Change ID | Change Type (`Add`/`Modify`/`Rename/Move`/`Remove`) | Current Path | Target Path | Rationale | Impacted Areas | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C-001 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Target Architecture Shape And Boundaries (Mandatory)

| Layer/Boundary | Purpose | Owns | Must Not Own | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

## File And Module Breakdown

| File/Module | Change Type | Layer / Boundary | Concern / Responsibility | Public APIs | Inputs/Outputs | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Layer-Appropriate Separation Of Concerns Check

- UI/frontend scope: responsibility is clear at view/component/store boundaries.
- Non-UI scope: responsibility is clear at file/module/service boundaries.
- Integration/infrastructure scope: each adapter/module owns one integration concern with clear contracts.

## Naming Decisions (Natural And Implementation-Friendly)

| Item Type (`File`/`Module`/`API`) | Current Name | Proposed Name | Reason | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Naming Drift Check (Mandatory)

| Item | Current Responsibility | Does Name Still Match? (`Yes`/`No`) | Corrective Action (`Rename`/`Split`/`Move`/`N/A`) | Mapped Change ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Existing-Structure Bias Check (Mandatory)

| Candidate Area | Current-File-Layout Bias Risk | Architecture-First Alternative | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Low/Medium/High |  | Keep/Change |  |

## Anti-Hack Check (Mandatory)

| Candidate Change | Shortcut/Hack Risk | Proper Structural Fix | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Low/Medium/High |  |  |  |

Rule:
- A functionally working local fix is still invalid here if it degrades layering or responsibility boundaries.

## Dependency Flow And Cross-Reference Risk

| Module/File | Upstream Dependencies | Downstream Dependents | Cross-Reference Risk | Mitigation / Boundary Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | Low/Medium/High |  |

## Allowed Dependency Direction (Mandatory)

- Allowed direction rules (example: `API -> Application -> Domain -> Infra`):
- Temporary boundary violations and cleanup deadline:

## Decommission / Cleanup Plan

| Item To Remove/Rename | Cleanup Actions | Legacy Removal Notes | Verification |

## Data Models (If Needed)

## Error Handling And Edge Cases

## Use-Case Coverage Matrix (Design Gate)

| use_case_id | Requirement | Use Case | Primary Path Covered (`Yes`/`No`) | Fallback Path Covered (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`) | Error Path Covered (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`) | Runtime Call Stack Section |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UC-001 | R-001 |  |  |  |  |  |

## Performance / Security Considerations

## Migration / Rollout (If Needed)

## Change Traceability To Implementation Plan

| Change ID | Implementation Plan Task(s) | Verification (Unit/Integration/API/E2E) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C-001 |  |  | Planned |

## Design Feedback Loop Notes (From Review/Implementation)

| Date | Trigger (Review/File/Test/Blocker) | Classification (`Local Fix`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`/`Unclear`) | Design Smell | Requirements Updated? | Design Update Applied | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | Yes/No |  |  |
